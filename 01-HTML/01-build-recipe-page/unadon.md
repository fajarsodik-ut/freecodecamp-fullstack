# Unadon: Japanese Eel Rice Bowl

## Description

Unadon is a classic Japanese dish featuring grilled freshwater eel (unagi) glazed with a sweet and savory sauce, served over a bed of steamed white rice. The eel is tender and flavorful, complemented by the rich, slightly sticky sauce and the fluffy rice. It's a comforting and surprisingly easy dish to make at home, even if you're new to Japanese cooking.

## Ingredients

### For the Eel:

- 1 pre-cooked, frozen unagi fillet (available at most Asian supermarkets)
- 1 tablespoon sake (Japanese rice wine) - optional, but helps tenderize

### For the Tare (Sauce):

- 4 tablespoons soy sauce
- 4 tablespoons mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)
- 2 tablespoons sake (Japanese rice wine)
- 2 tablespoons sugar

### For Serving:

- 2 cups cooked Japanese short-grain white rice (warm)
- Sansho pepper (Japanese prickly ash, optional, for sprinkling)
- Shredded nori (seaweed) or finely sliced green onions (for garnish, optional)

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Tare (Sauce):

- In a small saucepan, combine the soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar.
- Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.
- Reduce the heat to low and let it gently simmer for 5-7 minutes, or until the sauce slightly thickens to a syrupy consistency. Be careful not to burn it. Set aside.

### 2. Prepare the Unagi (Eel):

**Thawing (if frozen):** If your unagi is frozen, thaw it according to package directions, usually by placing it in the refrigerator overnight or running it under cold water.

**Prepping:** Pat the unagi fillet dry with paper towels. If using sake, lightly brush both sides of the unagi with about 1 tablespoon of sake.

**Cooking Options:**

- **Broiler/Grill (Recommended):** Preheat your broiler to high or set up your grill for medium-high heat. Line a baking sheet with foil for easy cleanup. Place the unagi skin-side down on the baking sheet. Broil for 3-5 minutes, or grill for 2-4 minutes, until the eel is heated through and the skin is slightly crispy.
- **Oven:** Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Place the unagi on a baking sheet lined with foil. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until heated through.
- **Pan-Frying:** Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Place the unagi skin-side down. Cook for 3-4 minutes, then flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until heated through.

**Glazing:** Once the unagi is hot, generously brush both sides with the prepared tare sauce. Continue to cook for another 1-2 minutes, brushing with more sauce, until the sauce is caramelized and glossy on the eel. Be careful not to burn it.

### 3. Assemble the Unadon:

- Divide the warm cooked rice into two serving bowls.
- Carefully slice the unagi fillet into 2-3 pieces if desired, or keep it whole.
- Place the glazed unagi over the rice in each bowl.
- Spoon an extra drizzle of the remaining tare sauce over the unagi and rice.
- Garnish with a sprinkle of sansho pepper, shredded nori, or sliced green onions if using.

### 4. Serve Immediately

Enjoy your delicious homemade Unadon!
