    <h1>Unadon: Japanese Eel Rice Bowl</h1>
    <p>
      Unadon is a classic Japanese dish featuring grilled freshwater eel (unagi)
      glazed with a sweet and savory sauce, served over a bed of steamed white
      rice. The eel is tender and flavorful, complemented by the rich, slightly
      sticky sauce and the fluffy rice. It's a comforting and surprisingly easy
      dish to make at home, even if you're new to Japanese cooking.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 pre-cooked, frozen unagi fillet (available at most Asian supermarkets)
      </li>
      <li>
        1 tablespoon sake (Japanese rice wine) - optional, but helps tenderize
      </li>
      <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sake (Japanese rice wine)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Tare (Sauce):</strong><br />
        In a small saucepan, combine the soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar.
        Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar
        dissolves. Reduce the heat to low and let it gently simmer for 5-7
        minutes, or until the sauce slightly thickens to a syrupy consistency.
        Be careful not to burn it. Set aside.

        <strong>Prepare the Unagi (Eel):</strong><br />
        <strong>Thawing (if frozen):</strong> If your unagi is frozen, thaw it
        according to package directions, usually by placing it in the
        refrigerator overnight or running it under cold water.<br /><br />
        <strong>Prepping:</strong> Pat the unagi fillet dry with paper towels.
        If using sake, lightly brush both sides of the unagi with about 1
        tablespoon of sake.<br /><br />
        <strong>Cooking Options:</strong><br />
        <em>Broiler/Grill (Recommended):</em> Preheat your broiler to high or
        set up your grill for medium-high heat. Line a baking sheet with foil
        for easy cleanup. Place the unagi skin-side down on the baking sheet.
        Broil for 3-5 minutes, or grill for 2-4 minutes, until the eel is heated
        through and the skin is slightly crispy.<br />
        <em>Oven:</em> Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Place the unagi on a
        baking sheet lined with foil. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until heated
        through.<br />
        <em>Pan-Frying:</em> Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Place the
        unagi skin-side down. Cook for 3-4 minutes, then flip and cook for
        another 2-3 minutes, until heated through.<br /><br />
        <strong>Glazing:</strong> Once the unagi is hot, generously brush both
        sides with the prepared tare sauce. Continue to cook for another 1-2
        minutes, brushing with more sauce, until the sauce is caramelized and
        glossy on the eel. Be careful not to burn it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble the Unadon:</strong><br />
        Divide the warm cooked rice into two serving bowls. Carefully slice the
        unagi fillet into 2-3 pieces if desired, or keep it whole. Place the
        glazed unagi over the rice in each bowl. Spoon an extra drizzle of the
        remaining tare sauce over the unagi and rice. Garnish with a sprinkle of
        sansho pepper, shredded nori, or sliced green onions if using.
      </li>

        <strong>Serve Immediately</strong><br />
        Enjoy your delicious homemade Unadon!
